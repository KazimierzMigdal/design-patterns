A Factory - is an object for creating other objects.
Another words creates objects without having to specify the exact class.
The Factory Method can be seen in the web framework Django.
For example, in a contact form of a web page,
the subject and the message
fields are created using the same form factory (CharField()),
even though they have different implementations according to their
purposes.

The code shows a way to localize words in two languages: English and Spanish.
"get_localizer" is the factory function that constructs a localizer depending on the language chosen.
The localizer object will be an instance from a different class according to the language localized.

However, the main code does not have to worry about which
localizer will be instantiated, since the method "localize" will be called
in the same way independently of the language.
