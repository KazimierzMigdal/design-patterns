Mediator is an object which attempts to make two or more decoupled
objects interact. The mediator handles the communication between
different classes (or objects of the same class), which allows for
zero (or little) dependency among them. The resultant decoupled code
is easy to maintain. The Mediator Design Pattern is a Behavioral Pattern
as it provides an industry-wide accepted method to handle communication
between objects.
